# Summerfruit syntax theme

A port of [Adrian Demleitner' Textmate Summerfruit theme](https://github.com/thgie/Summerfruit),
which itself is a port of [an old vim theme](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1872).

This port was created by converting it from the Textmate theme, then _slightly_
adjusting gutter margin & color as well as the invisibles to my liking.
