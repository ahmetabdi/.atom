Or maybe you're just curious what all the hype is about?\n\nType like a **pro** with this atom package - it will make mechanical keyboard noises when you type.\n\n# Usage\n\nBy default, the toggle switch is bound to `ctrl+alt-m k`. Toggle it on - whoa! Toggle it off - well, you're back to where you began.\n\n**Note** That's a two step key activation - `ctrl+alt+m` and then `k`.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the menu item that's found in the Packages Menu: `Packages->Mechanical Keyboard->Toggle`\n\n# Credit\n\nAll credit goes to the original mechanical keyboard project:\n- https://mechkey.herokuapp.com/\n- https://github.com/rewonc/mechkey\n\nSounds were sourced from freesfx.co.uk:\n- http://www.freesfx.co.uk\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/remanc/mechanical-keyboard/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/remanc/mechanical-keyboard","_id":"mechanical-keyboard@0.1.0","_shasum":"0767a5552cfbf8290d06ae2e9e60c76881734899","_resolved":"file:../d-11526-94951-1soyaum/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11526-94951-1soyaum/package.tgz"}
